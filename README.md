# DoingStuffWithData
1/25/22, Assignment called Doing Stuff With Data, use some local JSON and filter the data based on different ways: Age, height, name, or id. 
This assignment is also incomplete, pagination was not finished.

UPDATE: I redid this project after accumulating more experience programming. I returned to this project on 5/18/22. The way I left it previously was really buggy. While pagination is not present. I used a different approach this time around in which I utilzied select input fields to set the query parameters to sort through the information. In my previous attempt I solely relied on buttons to set the parameters and it was a mess. In addition to using select input fields I also implemented data validation in which an error message would pop up if one of the specified search parameters was missing while a query is being executed.
